    <main class="panel center">Summary:<br>Regular Show is an American animated television series that follows the surreal adventures of two best friends, Mordecai, a blue jay, and Rigby, a raccoon, who work as groundskeepers at a park. Despite their attempts to avoid work, they often find themselves in bizarre and supernatural situations. Their misadventures usually spiral out of control due to their own laziness, leading to encounters with cosmic forces, strange creatures, and over-the-top battles.

      Created by J.G. Quintel and aired on Cartoon Network from 2010 to 2017, *Regular Show* is known for its offbeat humor, nostalgic pop culture references, and quirky cast of characters, including their boss Benson (a gumball machine), Skips (an immortal yeti), Pops (a na√Øve lollipop man), and Muscle Man (an eccentric green-skinned man). The show balances humor and absurdity with moments of friendship and loyalty, making it popular with both children and adults. *Regular Show* won several awards and is considered one of the standout animated series of its era for its unique style and storytelling.</main>
